    - God could not play the bell sound effect consistently, so He took matters into His own hands. <cl>(And now there's a volume setting for it as well.)</c>
    - God also realized that the mod kept crashing in the level editor on Windows <cl>(and sometimes on Android), so He dropped support for it. (Level editor support in macOS is unaffected.)</c>
    - God also realized Jesus was a null texture on Android, and He decided to do something about it. <cl>(No more generic fallback texture!)</c>
    - God increased Jesus' picture quality by a tad smidge. <cl>(He was unable to pay the outrageous $14.50 USD fee Shutterstock demanded for the full quality image, and had to settle for less. Imagine if sales tax was included!)</c>
# 1.1.1
- God made a mistake with His function hooks.
